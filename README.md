Projecct 6
Static Node.js and Express Site

I created my first website and also display my portfolio. I have used node.js, Express, pug template and JSON package to make it work. 
I have listed my skills as well as my projects that I have worked on so far. This project it's a whole new world to me. As I improve myself with more skills, I will also update my portfolio to show off my creativities. My browser is open in the localhost:3000/

EXCEEDS
I have my json file runs with "npm start". I have created error pug file, that will send a error message to the server when the URL doen't exist. I have made some changes in my CSS style,I added box shadows, I change my font to "Tangerine', cursive" and background color to a grayish.
